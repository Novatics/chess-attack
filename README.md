# Chess Attack

This is a challenge proposed by me for the Coding Day 2019. The purpose is to develop common functionalities to chess games, writing tests to assert the implemented behaviour works as expected.

## Checkpoints

### Add a piece to the board

Given a chess board, I am supposed to be able to add a piece at a determined position. 

### Queen attack

Given the positions of two queens on a chess board, indicate whether or not a queen can attack the other if:
* they share a line
* they share a column
* they share a diagonal

### General attack

Repeat the functionality to the remaining pieces of a chess game:
* Knight
* Bishop
* Rook
* Pawn
* King


## General instructions

Install dependencies and running tests

```(bash)
  yarn
  yarn test
```

or, for npm users

```(bash)
  npm install
  npm test
```

## Feedback First Round
