# Chess Attack

This is a challenge proposed by me for the Coding Day 2019. The purpose is to develop common functionalities to chess games, writing tests to assert the implemented behaviour works as expected.

## Checkpoints

### Queen attack

Given the positions of two queens on a chess board, indicate whether or not they are positioned so that they can attack each other.

### General attack

Given the positions of any two pieces on a chess board, say if a piece is able to attack the other.

### Check

Given the current disposition of pieces on a chess board, indicate whether or not a determined king is in check.

## General instructions

* Install dependencies and running tests

```(bash)
  yarn
  yarn test
```

or, for npm users

```(bash)
  npm install
  npm test
```
